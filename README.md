# fractals-with-numba
* We create figures of some of the most famous fractals in math. 
* To accelerate the computation, so we can create high-resolution figures, we use numba.
* Numba translates our Python code into optimized machine code. On top of that, it makes parallel computing easy: https://numba.pydata.org/
